# ALE: what I did to get the environment right without using Conda is
# installed python 3.8 using `pyenv install 3.8`
# then, made it the global environment with `pyenv global 3.8`
# then, I created a virtualenv I could use to package all the required dependencies together with the exercises with
# python -m venv da_pandas_venv
# Then, I installed all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
# stop. That was it.
# If the requirements.txt throws error the next time, there's a chance that these comments are breaking it FYI.
